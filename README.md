# Flax
Flax is an ECMA6 iojs/nodejs framework designed to ease and accelerate development of large and scalable applications.

The meaning of "flax" is an inflexible version of the word "flex", not necessarily implying on the framework's inflexibility, but not necessarily not implying of it's flexibility.

Flax, like some other frameworks, takes the architectural enforcement approach rather than the modular approach. 

It contains the following elements / subsystems:

*   entity abstraction layer 
*   a minimal ORM with unified interface to different databases
*   event bus for cluster synchronization and consistency
*   http server wrapper
*   implementations of client web-services and UI elements
