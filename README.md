Flax is an ECMA6 iojs/nodejs framework - 


Flax, like some other framworks, takes the architectural enforcement approach rather than the modular approach. It contains the following elements / subsystems:
* entity abstraction layer 
* a minimal ORM with unified interface to different databases
* event bus for cluster synchronization and consistency
* http server wrapper
* implementations of client webservices and UI elements
